Novu Notifications – Server + Client Integration (In-App + Push via FCM)

This repo documents how we use Novu to send in-app and push notifications for three workflows:

Name:escalation.event → Identifier: escalation-event

Name: approval.event → Identifier: approval-event

Name: transaction.event → Identifier: transaction-event

Each workflow has two steps:

In-App

Title: {{payload.title}}

Body: {{payload.body}}

Redirect URL: {{payload.route}}

Push (FCM)

Title: {{payload.title}}

Body: {{payload.body}}

The backend triggers events with a uniform payload contract (see below). Push delivery uses Firebase Cloud Messaging configured in Novu’s Integrations store.



backend payload = {
                "title": content["title"],
                "body": content["body"],
                "eventType": event_type,
                "action": action,
                "route": route,
                "redirectUrl": route,  # For in-app notification
                **template_data  # Include all data for potential future use
        }
